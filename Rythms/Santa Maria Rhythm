Santa Maria Rhythm
Back in the old days, the Santa Maria rhythm was played to warn the capoerisatas that there is someone with a knife in the Roda.
These days some uses the Santa Maria rhythm for a game in the Roda that his goal is to grab an object  (usually money) that was left on the ground with the mouth.
