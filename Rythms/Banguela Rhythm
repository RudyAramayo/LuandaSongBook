Banguela Rhythm
Banguela rhythm was composed by Mestre Bimba and is played in the Capoeira Roda.
This rhythm has no  hand claping and no singing, it can be played in the beginning of the roda to warm up, Mestre Bimba also used it to calm the Roda if it got to tough.
When playing this rhythm the Capoeira game is usually slower and the movements are more close to the ground, where the capoeristas try to lead each other in the game without  interrupting one to the other.
