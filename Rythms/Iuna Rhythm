Iuna Rhythm
Iuna is a rhythm composed by Mestre Bimba, it is based on the voices of the Iuna birds.
The Iuna rhythm is composed of two parts, one is the male wooing sounds and the second is the female response.
Mestre Bimba used Iuna rhythm to show the “Cintura Desprezada” and “Sequencia de Bimba” in the Roda or to give respect to another Mestre or special guest that came to the Roda, only Formados where allowed to play Capoeira  with this rhythm.
Iuna rhythm is played with one Berimbau and two Pandeiros without any hand clapping or singing.
